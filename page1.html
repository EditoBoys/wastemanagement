                    <strong>What Is Waste Management</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Waste or rubbish is what we throw away every day. It includes everything from unwanted old cars to cigarette packets. As the amount of waste is growing rapidly all over the world and polluting the environment, the time has come to think about it very seriously. Waste management is the managing of waste by disposal and recycling of it. Moreover, waste management needs proper techniques keeping in mind the environmental situations. For instance, there are various methods and techniques by which the waste is disposed of. Some of them are Landfills, Recycling, Composting, etc. Furthermore, these methods are much useful in disposing of the waste without causing any harm to the environment. Wastes are classified into different types based on the physical appearance. Liquid wastes are liquid in nature, solid wastes are solid and organic wastes are organic in nature. Waste management for liquid wastes is different from solid and organic wastes. Wastes are also classified based on the degree of harm like hospital wastes are classified as infectious, highly infectious and general wastes. We cannot altogether get rid of our waste, but a proper management of it can certainly reduce it. If we think of burning, burying, recycling and thus reducing our waste, we can save our environment to a large extent. We can use some waste as fuel. We can use vegetable waste to make compost to improve our soil.
